You open up Liphium and the first thing you see: Select a town. And let's cut straight to the chase: You have no f\*\*\*\*ng idea what da hell we even want from you. What's a Liphium town? Is that edible? Can it walk? Yeah, well, none of those things, but let's try giving you a run-down of what the f\*\*k is going on here.

### What's a town on Liphium?

To give you the quick version, a town is basically a server on the internet that (like with other apps or services) provides certain functionality and features to you. We just call these servers towns cause it makes explaining Liphium and how it works a whole ton easier. If you don't really know what a server is, it's basically the thing that all of your data and account information is stored on. And those guys aren't free, you know. So for that reason, everyone on Liphium needs to have their own towns for their own friends cause I'm just too poor to maintain that stuff for everyone.

### The world of Liphium

This could be the title of some sort of MMO or some other game, but in the _great Liphium analogy_ it's actually just referencing the entire network of towns with people in them and the fact that _you_ can interact with all of those people. Imagine it like this, you have an account in a town with you and your friends and now you want to talk to someone outside of town. How are you gonna find them in such a big world with such a large amount of towns? Well, you need their **address**. Liphium can then use that address to find that specific user and send them a friend request. After that you two can like chat and stuff. Internally while this was in development I kinda always called this part of finding the other town Project Pathway. Kinda weird, I know. Make fun of this whole thing if you want, but in my eyes, it's the easiest way to explain this whole thing to someone without them getting bored after like 30 seconds.
