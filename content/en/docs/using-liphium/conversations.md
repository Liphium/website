Conversations and direct messages are the way to communicate with anyone, no matter if it's a group or just a single person. On Liphium direct messages and groups are both referred to as conversations as they are the same under the hood.

Guides on how to manage group permissions are currently still missing. We're still working on that and we'll write guides right here on this page once the system is finalized.

### Creating a conversation

**1.** Click on {{< icon >}}chat_bubble{{< /icon >}} in the search input in the top of the sidebar on desktop or click {{< icon >}}group_add{{< /icon >}} in the bottom right of the {{< icon >}}chat_bubble{{< /icon >}} tab on mobile.

**2.** Select all the members you want in your conversations by clicking on them. If you don't have any friends / contacts yet, there is a guide on how to add them available [here](/docs/using-liphium/friend-system).

**3.** If you have selected more than one member, you will be prompted to also enter a "Conversation name". That's the name of your conversation. If you just selected one member, the name of the conversation will be the name of the other person.

**4.** Click on the "Create" button.

### Editing a conversation

**3.** You'll now see options of what you can do with the conversation.

### Leaving a conversation

{{< hint >}}
On Desktop you can also hover over a conversation in the sidebar and just click the {{< icon >}}close{{< /icon >}} icon to leave a conversation. That'll make things easier than through the steps below.

**1.** Click on the conversation you want to leave / delete so you see the messages inside of it.

**2.** Click on the name of the conversation / the name of the friend you are in the conversation or click on {{< icon >}}more_vert{{< /icon >}} on mobile.

**3.** Now just click "{{< icon >}}logout{{< /icon >}} Leave conversation" and confirm that you want to leave the conversation.
