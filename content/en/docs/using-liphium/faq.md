If you have a question that's about the general stuff and not specifically about usage, you might find your answer <a href="/docs/general/faq">here</a> instead since we have a separate FAQ for all questions about everything else.

Welcome to our frequently asked questions page. If you have any question that should be here, please let us know! We'd like to expand this page to include as much information as possible because a lot of people only look for answers here.

In this frequently asked questions page, you'll find answers to questions about things we couldn't fit into the specialized usage guides. If you're searching for those, you'll find them in the sidebar or by pressing the button in the bottom right of your screen if you're on mobile.

### How do I find my own username?

**1.** Get to your own profile by clicking on your own name in the bottom left of the app or by going to the {{< icon >}}person{{< /icon >}} tab in the bottom bar of the mobile app.

**2.** Click {{< icon >}}content_copy{{< /icon >}} next to your display name to copy your own username to your clipboard.

If you want to add anyone, you might want to check out [this guide](./friend-adding.md).

### How do I find my own address?

### What does it mean to share my keys with someone?

When you send someone a friend request on Liphium, you will be prompted if you really want to share your keys with that friend. This is to make sure that you really want to give them the key (called "profile key") that is used to decrypt your status, profile picture and potential future features powered by this key. The thing with this key is that it **never changes** (we _might_ add options to change the key in the future, no promises though). This means the friend you add will **always be able to decrypt your status, profile picture, etc** (if they somehow find a way to get the encrypted data, for example through a data breach).

We plan on fixing this issue completely before the full release of Liphium, you should just be aware that it is something that can happen _for now_. Which is why we mention it here in the first place. So please wait until the full release before opening issues or pointing this issue out as a major flaw of Liphium. We're working on it.
