Your friends are like contacts on Liphium and probably the reason why you are using Liphium in the first place. So here we're gonna show you how you can add truly anyone, remove them and of course also find all the things in the first place. No matter which [town](../concepts/towns.md#whats-a-town-on-liphium) they're in.

### The friends page

When you want to search for a friend, remove a friend or even just add someone new you can perform all of these actions from the friends page. To find it, just click on {{< icon >}}group{{< /icon >}} in the bottom left of your sidebar right next to your name on desktop, or click the {{< icon >}}group{{< /icon >}} tab in the bottom bar of the mobile app.

### Adding someone in your town

When someone has their account on the same town as yours the process is as simple as it can be. All you need is their username to send them a friend request.

**5.** Click on "Yes" to confirm that you want to [share your keys with them](./faq.md#what-does-it-mean-to-share-my-keys-with-someone).

### Adding someone in a different town

When someone has their account in a different [town](../concepts/towns.md#whats-a-town-on-liphium) than you, you'll need [their address](./faq.md#how-do-i-find-my-own-address) or your own, depending on which way you want to do it.

### Removing a friend

Removing a friend is the same, no matter which town they are in.
