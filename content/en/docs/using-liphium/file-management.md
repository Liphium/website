There are currently two ways you can share files through Liphium. One is meant for small files like images, audio or small videos (by default smaller than 15 MB) and the other is meant for files of any size (literally any file can be shared). These two systems combined give you the power to share files really easily. For small files that will be stored forever after upload, there is also a [storage limit](#finding-my-storage-usage). You can find out how much storage you have left in your settings.

### Sending small files

If you want to share an image, audio or small video file this is the way to do it.

**1.** Open any conversation or space.

**2.** Click {{< icon >}}add{{< /icon >}} on the right in the message input field and attach any file you want. When you send the message, the file will be uploaded and your friends can then download it.

### Finding my storage usage

Your storage usage is how much storage you are using in your town. When you hit the limit, you can no longer upload files and will have to delete files.

**1.** Go to your settings by clicking {{< icon >}}settings{{< /icon >}} right in the bottom left on desktop or in the bottom bar of the mobile app.

**2.** Click on the "{{< icon >}}folder{{< /icon >}} Files" tab.

**3.** Your storage usage will be displayed above all the files you uploaded to the server. It should say something like "You are currently using 100 MB out of 1 GB.". That's how much storage you are using.

### Sending big files with Zap

Zap allows you to share files of any size or type within direct messages on Liphium. You can share anything like a 10 GB video file or something even larger. The only requirement for it is that you and the friend you want to send it to are online during the sending process.

**1.** Select the direct message with the friend you want to share the file with.

**2.** Click {{< icon >}}electric_bolt{{< /icon >}} (on mobile the button is hidden away in the {{< icon >}}more_vert{{< /icon >}} menu) and select the file you want to share.

**3.** After selecting the file a message has been sent, your friend just needs to click {{< icon >}}check{{< /icon >}} and then a progress bar will appear around the {{< icon >}}electric_bolt{{< /icon >}} icon. You can also click {{< icon >}}electric_bolt{{< /icon >}} again to see more information.

Your friend will also have to select a location for the file and after the transfer is complete the folder where the file is saved will open.
