The platform availability for Liphium is currently limited as we are still working on the app and are also still in the Beta phase. We hope you have a nice time on Liphium!

### Where your data is stored

Liphium generally only stores stuff in one location except for the temporary directory of your operating system. If you want to know more about where Liphium is storing certain data, you can find out more about that [in the storage locations part](/docs/using-liphium/storage-locations).

### Windows

Liphium is currently only available in the Microsoft Store as that is the cheapest and safest way of getting the app to your device. We might offer different ways in the future but that's how it is for now.
