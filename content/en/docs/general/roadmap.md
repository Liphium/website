Liphium is quite a large project and features come and go over time. If you have any suggestions for future additions or maybe even removals, make an issue on GitHub and maybe we'll consider what you want done. But please remember that Liphium is an open-source project and that we therefore work on the stuff that we want/need and often not what one person is demanding. If you want a better look at what was actually finished, you can check out [the changelog](https://github.com/Liphium/chat_interface/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## 2025

2025 is the year of Liphium finally becoming stable enough for general availability. There are so many things I want to ship this year, and one of them might just take Liphium to the next level altogether. I want to remind you that this is a really ambitious roadmap and that features might be delayed by months or even into 2026 altogether. Nothing is certain in programming and this is just me putting out some milestones that I think are achievable. No promises, but I'll say that I've been pretty good with hitting the milestones recently, so make of that what you will.

### May: 1.0.0 Beta

First, and this is the biggest and most ambitious goal in this entire roadmap: Finish all of the features Liphium has to offer by the End of April. Yes, that includes bringing back voice and video to Spaces and might even contain screenshares. We'll see how far we make it. But here is an entire list:

#### The exciting bits

- **Squares**: A new type of group conversation that can also list Spaces as a part of it as well as have multiple conversations in it (called Topics). This should make it easier for people who are more used to something like Discord to adopt Liphium.
- **Voice and video** will be returning to Spaces together with new revamped audio settings that support AI noise cancellation and microphone sensitivity (more audio processing related features like echo cancellation in the future).

#### Everything else

- Fix all major bugs and annoyances in the current version of Liphium
- Finally add password reset and key reset functionality
- Improve the performance and database layout of the app before it always needs an entire migration to merge major changes

#### The sad bits

- **Tabletop** will likely be removed for this update as maintaining it is just a too big of a burden with everything else going on right now. It will make a return and I will not forget about it, but for now it has too many bugs and flaws to ship it as stable.

### June: 1.0.0 Release

After the Beta is released, we'll take a whole month to ship out Liphium to as many platforms as we possibly can and also fix all the bugs that we encounter during testing. A big goal will also be to finally add tests to a lot of parts in Liphium to make sure it's as reliable as you would expect. I also want to review basically the entire source code to see if we find any obvious flaws or ways to improve the encryption in Liphium.

### The rest of 2025

Well, 1.0.0 makes this year exciting already, but I think for the rest of the year there will be plenty of things to get excited about as well. Since 1.0.0 will not have a mobile app most likely, I've actually been working on that side of Liphium for quite a while. It shouldn't take that long to get it working properly, but there are of course still some things that need improvement as always. There are lots of ideas floating around in my head and one of them is actually already quite far when it comes to the concepting phase. You'll hear about that one when the time is right and I don't want to spoil it because that would be boring. So for now, 1.0.0 should be exciting enough, I'm sure we'll publish another roadmap after it's done because, well, development also needs to continue after it.

Just so you know, 1.0.0 is not the end. Far from it actually. My dreams about what to do with this platform are nearly not over and trust me when I say this: Liphium has so much more potential to push the boundaries of what a chat app can do even further. And 1.0.0 is just the beginning of this journey.
