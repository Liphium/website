Liphium is quite a large project and features come and go over time. If you have any suggestions for future additions or maybe even removals, make an issue on GitHub and maybe we'll consider what you want done. But please remember that Liphium is an open-source project and that we therefore work on the stuff that we want/need and often not what one person is demanding. If you want a better look at what was actually finished, you can check out [the changelog](https://github.com/Liphium/chat_interface/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## 2024

Liphium has grown quite a lot in 2024. Throughout June and July decentralization was finally complete and at the end of August first versions of Liphium were released as downloadable and had instructions to get set up. This year is all about getting the basics right and making sure Liphium is available on the first mobile and desktop platforms.

### Project Lightwire

Because audio and video calls have been removed and all of the code has been deleted from the codebase, we are planning to reintroduce this functionality throughout 2025. The goal of Project Lightwire is building a audio and video streaming technology on top of RDP to serve the needs of all ideas we want to implement in the future. This doesn't just stop at audio and video calls. You can read more about those ideas in the 2025 section of this page.

### Goals for November

This November is all about making Liphium simpler and trying to port it to more platforms. Web support has already been achieved in October and this month is all about porting Liphium to Android and making sure it works properly there. Here's a more general list.

- Release a first Beta version of the Liphium mobile app on Android
- Add chatting functionality to Spaces to make Tabletop a little bit more usable
- Prepare Spacestation (the backend for all things Spaces) for more advanced features
- Get rid of unused code and improve startup performance
- Make Zap run at full internet speed


### Goals for December

I'll admit that it's a little early to start talking about December, but here's a general idea for what's coming then.

- A new feature that I won't say anything about here yet, as it's not certain
- Lots of bug and performance fixes
- Start with really basic implementation and experimenting to prepare for Project Lightwire
- Porting of Liphium to Linux (but that's not fully certain yet)


## 2025

In 2025, I want to evolve Liphium beyond what it currently is. It shouldn't just be about chatting anymore. I want it to be a place for events and make sure our audio and video features support this vision. One priority is making it really simple to set up a Liphium server and trying to make it even easier. Project Lightwire will be a major part of that and while streaming audio will be **much** easier than video, both are planned and will hopefully be supported at the end of 2025.

### Our collaboration with Vultris

If you read the Impressum of this page, you may already know what's coming. Liphium isn't becoming proprietary, but we need ways to make it sustainable and make it even simpler to host towns. The simplest way for someone to host a town would be by just paying for a server and everything being installed for you. As a part of Vultris we'll finally be able to achieve that vision.
