Welcome to our frequently asked questions page. If you have any question that should be listed here, please let us know! We'd like to expand this page to include as much information as possible because a lot of people only look for answers here.

### Where do I get Liphium?

Liphium is still in an alpha state, but if you are probably gonna try anyway. You first need to set up a server with Liphium Station (or get a friend that has a Liphium instance to send you an invite code) and then connect to it using one of our apps. Setting up your own Liphium instance is quite complicated and since there are no guides (for now), you should probably wait for that. But if you're willing to try it out, the code is always available on our GitHub repository.

### Why make another chat app?

I wrote a whole blog post about that. You can find it [here](/blog/why-another-chat-app.md).

### What is Liphium?

Come on, if that's your question, just go to the main page or click on "Documentation" again in the navbar above the title of this documentation entry. I don't want to paste that gigantic thing into here again. You can just look at it there.

### Why the f*** is the Liphium server using a restrictive license?

Well, you see, for me as a solo developer working on this project for a couple of years now I want to make sure that no company can take the opportunity of selling the software I created from me. Open Source has a gigantic funding problem, and that's not anything new. I might eventually want to make money with this app, not by doing monetizing you or your data in the client app (that's why the app itself is under the GPL!), but by selling servers that have Liphium on them already. This isn't something I'm working on right now, but I want to have the possibility to be the only person selling these servers and to make a little bit of money off of it in the future.
