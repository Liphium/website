Welcome to our frequently asked questions page. If you have any question that should be listed here, please let us know! We'd like to expand this page to include as much information as possible because a lot of people only look for answers here.

### Where do I get Liphium?

Liphium is still in an alpha state, but if you are probably gonna try anyway. You first need to set up a server with Liphium Station (or get a friend that has a Liphium instance to send you an invite code) and then connect to it using one of our apps. Setting up your own Liphium instance is quite complicated and since there are no guides (for now), you should probably wait for that. But if you're willing to try it out, the code is always available on our GitHub repository.

### Why make another chat app?

That's actually a good question. Liphium was born out of the need to have an alternative to Discord that doesn't suck in terms of privacy and features. Me and my friends have been using Discord to communicate for a really long time. But the feature we mostly use are private messages and calls. And all of that is not end-to-end encrypted which honestly sucks. While trying out so many alternatives that were already out there, nothing was a great fit. The lacking audio settings were the biggest problem since we don't want to hear each other's background noise and it is still a miracle to me how other apps have not addressed this issue yet. I mean I can't blame them because they are mostly mobile focused anyway. Which is another problem, Discord is optimized for "gamers" and also for desktop usage while other apps have lacking features in this regard. With Liphium, we try to address all of these problems once and for all. You need to be the judge of wether we succeeded with this vision or not.

### What is Liphium?

Come on, if that's your question, just go to the main page or click on "Documentation" again in the navbar above the title of this documentation entry. I don't want to paste that gigantic thing into here again. You can just look at it there.
