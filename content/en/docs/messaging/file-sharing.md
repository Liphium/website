There are currently two ways you can share files through Liphium. One is meant for small files like images, audio or small videos (by default smaller than 15 MB) and the other is meant for files of any size (literally any file can be shared). These two systems combined give you the power to share files really easily. For small files that will be stored forever after upload, there is also a [storage limit](#finding-my-storage-usage) you can check in your settings.

### Sending small files

If you want to share an image, audio or small video file this is the way to do it.
