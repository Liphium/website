Welcome to Liphium's help and resources page. You are one of the few people that check out the help articles before reaching out, huh? Thanks, I wish everyone was like you.

### Are you trying to set up a town/server?

If you're trying to set up a town, we have [separate documentation](https://docs.liphium.com) to cover everything related to town setup and how to maintain a town. You can also learn more about all the settings and stuff. If you have a town or are an administrator in one, be sure to check it out to get to know it just a bit better.

### Liphium is still in its alpha

While Liphium is already sort of available to the public, it's not yet available through official stores like the Google Play Store, the App Store or stores like Flathub on Linux. We ask that you don't judge us for breaking changes or bugs that might happen for this period. Liphium is currently changing quite fast and stuff like the [recent removal of audio and video calls](https://github.com/Liphium/chat_interface/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) is normal and should be expected.

### Installation of the app

Liphium is currently on available on Windows by installing it [through a script](/docs/installation/windows). You can check out instructions here. We're planning to make the app more widely available throughout 2025.

### Setup of a town (a Liphium instance)

Setting up a Liphium town can be quite difficult. That's why we have a full guide on how to set one up using the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/liphium/chat). You get a complete deployment together with HTTPS using Nginx and Certbot. It's not something for beginners though.

### A map of what's ahead

You can also simply view what we're planning on rolling out for future releases [over here](/docs/general/roadmap). We're always very transparent about what's coming for the future of Liphium. If you're curious, just check it out. If you want to suggest something for the future, you can create an issue over on GitHub.
