Welcome to Liphium's help and resources page. You are one of the few people that check out the help articles before reaching out, huh? Thanks, I wish everyone was like you.

### Are you trying to set up a town/server?

We are currently in the process of splitting all of the documentation into two different pages. One for developers & town administrators and one for general users to make the guides better for everyone. Because of that, we're sorry if there are articles missing in the current version of the documentation and hope that the split is gonna help make the documentation better.

### Liphium is still in its alpha

While Liphium is already sort of available to the public, it's not yet available through official stores like the Google Play Store, the App Store or stores like Flathub on Linux. We ask that you don't judge us for breaking changes or bugs that might happen for this period. Liphium is currently changing quite fast and stuff like the [recent removal of audio and video calls](https://github.com/Liphium/chat_interface/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) is normal and should be expected.

### Installation of the app

Liphium is currently on available on Windows by installing it [through a script](/docs/installation/windows). You can check out instructions here. A mobile release for Android is planned by the end of November 2024. The app will be made available on more platforms throughout 2025.

### Setup of a town (a Liphium instance)

Setting up a Liphium town can be quite difficult. That's why we have a full guide on how to set one up using the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/liphium/chat). You get a complete deployment together with HTTPS using Nginx and Certbot. It's not something for beginners though.

### A map of what's ahead

You can also simply view what we're planning on rolling out for future releases [over here](/docs/general/roadmap). We're always very transparent about what's coming for the future of Liphium. If you're curious, just check it out. If you want to suggest something for the future, you can create an issue over on GitHub.
