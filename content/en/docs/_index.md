If you're trying to set up a town, we have a <a href="https://docs.liphium.com">separate documentation</a> to cover everything related to town setup and how to maintain a town. You can also learn more about all the settings and stuff. If you have a town or are an administrator in one, be sure to check it out to get to know it just a bit better.

Welcome to Liphium's help and resources page. You are one of the few people that check out the help articles before reaching out, huh? Thanks, I wish everyone was like you.

### Liphium is still in its alpha

While Liphium is already sort of available to the public, it's not yet available through official stores like the Google Play Store, the App Store or stores like Flathub on Linux. We ask that you don't judge us for breaking changes or bugs that might happen for this period. Liphium is currently changing quite fast and stuff like the [recent removal of audio and video calls](https://github.com/Liphium/chat_interface/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) is normal and should be expected.

### Searching the documentation

I'm sorry to say this, but there is currently no way to search the documentation straight on the page. If you want to search for something, you can use a search engine like DuckDuckGo and just add `site:liphium.com` to your query. This works basically the same way and is the reason why we've decided to not offer search here as a search engine is gonna do a much better job at this then we ever could. At the end of the day, it's also because I'm lazy of course.

### A map of what's ahead

You can also simply view what we're planning on rolling out for future releases [over here](/docs/general/roadmap). We're always very transparent about what's coming for the future of Liphium. If you're curious, just check it out. If you want to suggest something for the future, you can create an issue over on GitHub.
