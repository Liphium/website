title: "Privacy Policy and Terms of Service"

**Effective: 24.04.2024, last updated: 24.04.2024** \n
Your privacy and security matters to us, which is why we collect only minimal amounts of information
that are needed to enhance user experience and help us better understand how Liphium is used within
our network of self-hosted servers anyone can host. If you've got any further questions, just go
ask man, it was already a pain in the ass to write the entire platform and now this, so please
don't complain to me in court, at least do it per email or something (you're probably a lawyer
or something reading this). If you're trying to copy paste a Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
this may not be the right place, because I totally didn't do that for this one. The previous sentence
was of course irony, a joke or something similar you might not understand as a lawyer and we take
privacy and security very seriously.

## Definitions

- When we say “Liphium”, “us”, “our” or “we” in this document, we are referring to the Liphium platform as in the parts we actually host and own ourselves. This does not include any server, instance, installation or node hosted by a third-party or individual, even if associated with the Liphium project ("third-party server"). The privacy policy of that third-party server safeguards your data privacy and security on that specific server, instance or node.
- When we say our “services” in this document, this encompasses all websites, platforms, apps or software associated with, distributed or created by us.

## When this changes

We may change our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service at any time. Agreeing to this document means you agree to all future versions of this document. We will notify you about any changes we make to this document and state when it was updated and when it will become effective. The notifications will reach you through our app, but if doesn't notify you, well that's your thing. Let your friends tell you or something because this document is REALLY important and any updates we make are gonna make you worry REAL hard because you have of course read through this document multiple times to understand how we use your data.

## Consent

By using any of our Services as well as this website you agree to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. I feel like that's kinda obvious, but we need to state it here, you know.

# Terms of Service

As we do not host Liphium for anyone else, this privacy policy can not cover what a third-party server does cause that's up to them. We may send out user surveys or other ways of collecting information about how our app is used that will be communicated with the user using a popup window or other bits of information throughout the app. I promise we won't annoy you with that shit. These surveys or ways of collecting usage information will always be disabled by default and something the user needs to agree to by clicking a button or link, or by clearly communicating their agreement in any other way. Just check your settings to see what we collect and if you don't like it turn it off and don't go complain to us because you accidentally turned it on.

The usage requirements for our services may vary per country, region or whatever else you might be living in. If you're under 13, you may need approval from your parents to use our services, but that's your responsibility now, because this document declares that.


# Privacy policy

Our privacy policy is designed to help you find out how our Services handle "Personally identifiable information" ("PII", "PP"). PII is information that can be used to identify contact or track a single person or individual in context. Please read this document carefully to make sure you understand how we handle your PII. Because I wrote "PP" up there, I can now use PP to describe your personal information. In that case let's say your "PP" is short, we know, cause we store it you know, but only anonymously of course.

## What personal information do we collect from visitors or users of our services?

Our Services only collect minimal information about your usage and it differs per service we provide to you, so here's a list of all the things we collect in different places and why we collect it (that's why your "PP" is short and only anonymous):
- **The Liphium app.** The Liphium app is our cross-platform app that is available on almost any platform. It may prompt you take part in surveys or other ways for us to look at how you use the app. We use this information to enhance the user experience and make the app better for everyone. We will never collect any information without your consent. The Liphium app may also make requests to [GitHub](https://github.com) to check for updates and may also download the latest release from there. Their privacy policy safeguards this usage. We also make regular requests to this page you are on right now or our Services to check if you have accepted our agreements (like the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy) or if there are some news you might've missed.
- **On liphium.com and other websites we own.** This encompasses the entirety of the liphium.com website and other websites we own such as our blog. On these websites we don't currently collect any information about how you use our websites. However, [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), our service provider for these, collects analytics every time you view any of them that they share with us in an anonymous manner. This includes everything you automatically share with them through a request like your IP address and the URL you're accessing, there may also be additional data not listed here (please refer to Cloudflare's Privacy Policy for this information). We may publish these analytics in anonymous manner, for example in a report or blog post to share growth numbers or other insights with our users. The collection of this data is safeguarded by Cloudflare's Privacy Policy.

## When do we collect personal information

Our Services collect the outlined information either automatically or through your actions like submitting a form, entering an input or clicking a button/link.

## How do we use your information?

We may use the information you provide the us through earlier described actions in various ways:
- **In the Liphium app.** A bit of how we use it is already outlined in the previous 2 paragraphs, but we would still like to inform you that we use this data to improve our services and give you a better product as a result. If you have any concerns about the data we collect inside of Liphium, please contact us. The requests to GitHub occur to give you the latest and greatest updates we push out to users. We want to you to always be on the latest version so you can experience what we build for you, and even how we may use the data you may give to us.
- **On liphium.com and other websites.** On our websites we use the analytics data to review how certain projects or features are doing and how we may improve them in the future The data Cloudflare provides to us is important for us to see how people interact with our website and how we may improve it in the future.

For all of the information we collect we may also need to respond to legal requests for your data as required by local law. This is something we cannot control and will absolutely try to prevent. All of data is anonymous anyway, so why would legal entities even want it?

## Any other tracking things that need to be here

We don't use "cookies" or any of that other stuff you can use to track people. If you have any questions that aren't answered just contact us instead of pulling up to the police, seriously. And I'll not be explaining "cookies" to you since you probably already know what they are and if you're a lawyer and want this document to say what they are even though we're not using them, you're just stupid, sorry.

## Third party disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property or safety.

## Discourse from this document

Any of the information in this paragraph has nothing to do with the privacy of users on Liphium and may be seen as irrelevant no matter what is written here. Okay, disclaimer upfront, let's be real, I hate writing this legal bullshit and just want you to know that we generally want you to feel safe on Liphium and if there is anything you'd like us to do about a particular situation even if we're not associated, reach out, please! We'll always try to help you no matter what problem you have with the platform. The easiest thing to do is to always just ask us, we won't respond in a rude manner, trust!

## Contact

Refer to our [Impressum](/impressum) for that (it's another German thing I need to do because else I'll be screwed and don't even ask why they want you to publicly leak your address). I now have to spend 20€ on something to get myself a different address. It's kinda annoying.
