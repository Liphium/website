**Effective: 24.04.2024, last updated: 24.04.2024**

We take your privacy and security seriously. On that note, this site doesn't collect a whole lot of data so that isn't too complicated. In this Privacy Policy we inform you how we process, potentially store and work with your information on our website, app and other services we may provide to you.

## Definitions

- When we say “Liphium”, “us”, “our” or “we” in this document, we are referring to the Liphium platform as in the parts we actually host and own ourselves. This does not include any server, instance, installation or node hosted by a third-party or individual, even if associated with the Liphium project ("instance"). The privacy policy of that instance safeguards your data privacy and security on that specific instance. Please consult the admin of the instance to get to know more about how they use your data.
- When we mention our “services” in this document, this encompasses all websites or platforms running our own servers. It also includes all apps and software distributed or created by us. This does not cover self-hosted instances as they are not, in any way, related to us or controlled by us.

## Consent and changes

We may change our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service at any time. Agreeing to this document means you agree to all future versions of this document. We will notify you about any changes we make to this document. You can read about when it was last changed and when it became effective at the top of the page. Even if you don't get a notification about changes, your agreement to this document means you also agree to any future versions of this document. In general, by using any of our Services you agree to the entirety of this document as well as our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

# Terms of Service

As we do not host an instance for anyone, this privacy policy **can not cover** what an instance may do since that is up to the owner of that particular instance. We may send out user surveys or other ways of collecting information about how our Services are used. This will be communicated using a dialog. These surveys or ways of collecting usage information will in some cases be enabled by default and something you may need to disable to by clicking a button or link. Just check your settings to see what we collect and if you don't like it turn it off.

The usage requirements for our Services may vary per country, region or whatever else you might be living in. If you're under 13, you may need approval from your parents to use our Services. These rules can vary per region, so we expect you to check these rules before agreeing to this document. Since we do not control who uses our Services, we take no responsibility for cases where the requirement outlined above isn't met.

We also take no responsibility for any misuse or abuse of our the software or apps we provide since we do not control how these apps are used and have no control over the instance they are connected to. We also do not take responsibility for any breaking of the law, data privacy incidents or security incidents on these instances for the same reasons. Please do not contact us in such cases, only if there is something we can do about it like when the used method is through an exploit we can patch in our server software (please contact us in such cases).


# Privacy policy

Our privacy policy is designed to help you find out how our Services handle "Personally identifiable information" ("PII", "personal information"). PII is information that can be used to identify contact or track a single person or individual in context. Please read this document carefully to make sure you understand how we handle your PII.

## What personal information do we collect from visitors or users of our services?

Our Services only collect minimal information and it differs per service we provide to you, so here's a list of all the things we collect in different places and why we collect it:
- **The Liphium app.** The Liphium app is our cross-platform app that is available on almost any platform. It may prompt you take part in surveys or other ways for us to look at how you use the app (read more about that in the Terms of Service above). We use this information to enhance the user experience and make the app better for everyone. The Liphium app may also make requests to [GitHub](https://github.com) to check for updates and may also download the latest release from there. Their privacy policy safeguards this (please read it to see how your data is used). We also make regular requests to our Services to check if you have accepted our agreements (like the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy) or if there are some other future use cases that may require connection to our Services. We do this to ensure you get a notification about important news and new versions of this agreement.
- **On liphium.com and other websites we own.** This encompasses all websites within our Services. On these websites we don't currently collect any information about how you use our websites. However, [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), our service provider for these Services, collects analytics every time you view any of them that they share with us. This includes everything you automatically share with them through a HTTP request like your IP address and the URL you're accessing, there may also be additional data not listed here. We may publish these analytics in anonymous manner, for example in a report or blog post to share growth numbers or other insights with our users. To know more about this information, please go to Cloudflare's Privacy Policy for this.

## When do we collect personal information

Our Services collect the outlined information either automatically or through your actions like submitting a form, entering an input or clicking a button/link.

## How do we use your information?

We may use the information you provide to us through earlier described actions in various ways:
- **In the Liphium app.** A bit of how we use it is already outlined in the previous 2 paragraphs, but we would still like to inform you that we use this data to improve our services and give you a better product as a result. If you have any concerns about the data we collect inside of our Services, please contact us. The requests to GitHub occur to give you the latest and greatest updates we push out to users. We want to you to always be on the latest version so you can experience what we build for you, and even how we may use the data you may give to us.
- **On liphium.com and other websites.** On our websites (included in our Services) we use the analytics data to review how certain projects or features are doing and how we may improve them in the future. The data Cloudflare provides to us is important for us to see how people interact with our website and how we may improve it in the future.

For all of the information we collect we may also need to respond to legal requests for your data as required by local law. This is something we cannot control. By agreeing to this document, you agree to allow us to respond to legal requests for you data with everything they want us to send them.

## Cookies

We do not use them because you would otherwise get a popup asking you to accept them. We don't want to bother you with that, so yeah, I just thought I would mention it here so you know you're safe. Cloudflare may use them though, check their Privacy Policy to see how they may use "cookies".

## Third party disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include service hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our Services, conducting our business, or serving our users, as long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property or safety.

## Contact

If you have any questions about how we use your information on our Services you can always reach out. Refer to our [Impressum](/impressum) for that. It has all the information you need to get in contact with us. But please use the email we mention in there. We might not otherwise respond to your requests.
