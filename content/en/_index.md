  - heading: Completely decentralized
    icon: public
    description: Liphium's global network is powered by the servers you host. You are in control of your own data and can share that burden with your friends. Although that also means you'll have to set up a server first, sorry!
  - heading: The best online card game experience
    icon: table_restaurant
    description: Within our calls or Spaces, as we call them, you can play basically any card game by using Tabletop, our infinite canvas. Even more is coming soon!
  - heading: Everything you do is secure
    icon: lock
    description: While we don't build on an existing protocol, we use libsodium to ensure that our own one is as battle-tested as possible. We hope this protocol holds, but if you find anything, please let us know first!
  - heading: High quality audio
    icon: equalizer
    description: We have lots of voice and audio settings, you can even set stuff like microphone sensitivity. This was actually the initial motivation to create this app, while we haven't delivered on it fully, it still works well enough.
  - heading: Never worry about that silly big file again
    icon: content_copy
    description: With Live Share you can share files up to any size with your friends. Have that silly big video file you can't get across the globe? This system can help you with that.
  - heading: Save all your favorite memes to one place
    icon: folder
    description: Most apps have stuff like stickers and GIFs and animated images you can spam people with. But creation is often hard, so on Liphium, you can save any image or GIF to your Library.
