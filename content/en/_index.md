  title: "A chat app with more fun."
  description: "Chat apps didn't change much in the last few years. Liphium is a novel approach to the design and feature set of a chat app. The app has so many unique features and twists, I think you'll love it."
features:
  - heading: Never worry about that silly big file again
    icon: electric_bolt
    description: With Zap you can share files up to any size with your friends. It's like AirDrop or QuickShare, but over the internet at the same speed as your internet connection. And you don't have to be in the same room.
  - heading: High quality audio
    icon: equalizer
    description: When you're in a call, the most important thing is audio quality. For that reason, Liphium has many audio features such as Microphone sensitivity that many other apps lack to make sure no-one hears your keyboard noise.
  - heading: The best online card game experience
    icon: table_restaurant
    description: Within our calls or Spaces, as we call them, you can play basically any card game by using Tabletop, our infinite canvas. Even more is coming soon!
  - heading: All your images and memes in one place
    icon: folder
    description: GIFs are cool, but sometimes static images also do the trick. With Liphium's Library you can save both images and GIFs to one place, so you never have to create a meme folder again.
  - heading: Completely decentralized
    icon: public
    description: Liphium isn't hosted by us, it is powered by the servers you host. You are in control of your own data. Although that also means you'll have to set up an instance first, sorry! Although we might be able to help you with that in the future ^^
  - heading: End-to-end encryption by default
    icon: lock
    description: While we can't guarantee that our encryption protocol will be safe, we use industry standard end-to-end encryption libraries to provide you with the privacy every chat app should have. If you find any issues, please let me know!
